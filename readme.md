ABM course project: Modified Schelling Model

stuff so far:
model_basic: basic schelling model with grid size, number of agent types, similarity threshold, empty cell ratio
model_upgraded_hanna: adds agent weights, multiple move strategies, prices per cell with agents preferring cheapest cells
model_upgraded_jonas: increase prices near center
model_upgraded_benja: adds prices per cell based on number of neighbors and agent wealth, with agents preferring most expensive affordable cells
model_combined: combine above approaches, add points of interest that agents want to move closer to depending on preferences, maybe model real city
